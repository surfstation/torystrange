              <li>Product Questions
                <ul>
                  <li>Is there a text overlay, or other watermark, on the actual prints?
                    <ul>
                      <li>No. The actual prints do not have a text overlay or watermark. The text overlays are only present on some of the website's images in order to clearly display the title of the work.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Are the prints signed?
                    <ul>
                      <li>We offer unsigned, signed, and limited signed prints. Please see the detail page of the specific photograph for more information. If you order a signed print, or limited signed print, the print will be hand-signed by Tory Strange.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>What is a limited signed print?
                    <ul>
                      <li>First, a limited signed print is a print that is hand-signed by Tory Strange. Second, a limited signed print is a print that is numbered as part of a limited set of that style and size of print that will be created. We will not make available both a signed, and limited signed, print of the same style and size. If a print is made available as a limited signed print, then only one of the limited signed set is available at that particular style and size. An individual photograph may have two or more distinct sets of limited signed prints, if the print is made available in different styles and/or sizes. For example, an individual photograph could have three sets of limited signed prints if it is made available as: 1) 13x19 Luster print, 2) 13x19 Metallic print, 3) and 24x36 Luster print.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Are the prints numbered? Are any of the prints limited edition?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Some prints are numbered as part of a set of limited signed prints. Prints that are not numbered are open edition. Please see the detail page of the specific photograph for more information.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Is a certificate of authenticity (COA) included with each print?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Yes.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Is there more information about the mounting and framing options that are offered for sale with the prints?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Please find details about the standard mounting and framing that is offered <a href="mount-frame.html">here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>What is a "Luster Print" or "Epson Premium Luster Print"?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Both names refer to the same thing. This type of photographic paper print has a true luster finish and traditional photographic feel. This type of print comes out clean and sharp, with vivid color and smooth tonal range.</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>What is a "Canvas Wrap", "Canvas Wrap Print", or "Epson Exhibition Canvas Wrap Print"?
                    <ul>
                      <li>All three names refer to the same thing. This type of photographic print is made on a 23 mil thick, acid free, lignin free elegantly textured cotton poly blend. All canvas prints include a protective UV spray coating.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
